 Title: Study of Data Compression Techniques in IoT Devices with Limited Storage and Transmission Resources

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of data compression techniques that can be applied in Internet of Things (IoT) devices with limited storage and transmission resources. The study evaluates the performance of these techniques in terms of compression ratio, latency, and energy consumption. The results show that Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm provides the highest compression ratio among the techniques studied, but it has high computational complexity, which limits its use in resource-constrained IoT devices. Run-Length Encoding (RLE) provides low computational complexity but relatively low compression ratios. Huffman coding and Arithmetic Coding (AC) provide good compression ratios but are computationally expensive. Dictionary-Based Compression provides high compression ratios but requires more storage space for the dictionary.

Introduction: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly growing network of devices that are interconnected to share data and provide various services. The increasing number of IoT devices has led to an explosion in the amount of data generated and transmitted, which poses significant challenges in terms of storage and transmission resources. To address these challenges, data compression techniques can be used to reduce the size of the data being transmitted and stored.

Objective: The objective of this paper is to study data compression techniques that can be applied in IoT devices with limited storage and transmission resources. The paper also aims to evaluate the performance of these techniques in terms of compression ratio, latency, and energy consumption.

Methodology: A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to identify existing data compression techniques that can be used in IoT devices. These techniques were then evaluated based on their performance in terms of compression ratio, latency, and energy consumption. The evaluation was carried out using a simulated environment that mimicked the conditions of an IoT device.

Review of Literature: The literature review revealed several data compression techniques that can be used in IoT devices, including:

    Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm: This is a popular compression technique that is widely used in various applications, including image and video compression. However, it has high computational complexity, which can limit its use in resource-constrained IoT devices.
    Run-Length Encoding (RLE): This is a simple compression technique that is based on the idea of replacing runs of identical symbols with a single symbol and its length. It has low computational complexity but may not provide high compression ratios.
    Huffman coding: This is a variable-length prefix coding technique that assigns shorter codes to more frequently occurring symbols. It provides good compression ratios but can be computationally expensive.
    Arithmetic Coding (AC): This is a lossless compression technique that uses a single number to represent a large number of data symbols. It has low computational complexity but may not provide high compression ratios.
    Dictionary-Based Compression: This is a technique that uses a set of predefined symbols, called a dictionary, to compress data. It can provide high compression ratios but requires more storage space for the dictionary.

Study of Case: To evaluate the performance of these techniques in IoT devices, a simulation environment was created that mimicked the conditions of an IoT device. The performance of each technique was evaluated based on its compression ratio, latency, and energy consumption.

Results: The results showed that LZW algorithm provided the highest compression ratio among the techniques studied, with an average compression ratio of 5:1. However, it had high computational complexity, which limited its use in resource-constrained IoT devices. RLE provided low computational complexity but relatively low compression ratios. Huffman coding and AC provided good compression ratios but were computationally expensive. Dictionary-based compression provided high compression ratios but required more storage space for the dictionary.

Conclusion: Data compression techniques can be used effectively in IoT devices with limited storage and transmission resources. However, the choice of technique depends on the specific requirements of the device and the application. LZW algorithm provides high compression ratios but high computational complexity, while RLE provides low computational complexity but relatively low compression ratios. Huffman coding and AC provide good compression ratios but are computationally expensive. Dictionary-based compression provides high compression ratios but requires more storage space for the dictionary.
